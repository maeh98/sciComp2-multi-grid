# Darcy Flow Multi-Grid numerical simulation. 2021 
Authors: Rahul Banerjee, Hemraj Chauhan, Maurits Descamps, Manuel Ehrlich, Andreas Probst.

This Group Project numerically solves a 2D Darcy equation which models the percolation of a fluid through the ground.
We employed the V-Cycle Multi-Grid Method to solve the problem, such that the computational cost is O(N). We implemented the code in a Jupyter Notebook in Python.
